# CMPN205-GraphicsGame

Computer Graphics Project - third year CUFE students.

This project consisted of three phases:
  - Getting familiar with loading and using OpenGL and GLSL shaders.
  - Implementing meshes, textures, samplers, lights, and more, as shown in the [phase 2 + 3 document](https://github.com/ziyadss/CMPN205-GraphicsGame/blob/main/Phase%202%20%2B%203/instructions.pdf).
  - Proof-of-concept of a game where you have to shoot colored blocks with their complement-colored bullets in order to remove them from the world, with the game world being loaded from an external JSON file.
